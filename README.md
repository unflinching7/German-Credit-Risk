# German Credit Risk Assessment

## Executive Summary
In the German banking sector, effective credit risk assessment is crucial for timely repayments and maintaining strong credit performance. Despite efforts in credit scoring, persistent loan defaults led to our focused data mining project on the German credit dataset.

## Goal/Motivation
Our goal was to address challenges in credit risk assessment specific to the German financial landscape, considering cultural and regulatory nuances.

## Method/Data
Utilizing the German Credit dataset, our structured data analytics process included preprocessing and preparation, model prediction, training, and evaluation, parameter tuning and feature engineering. Models such as Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and Naïve Bayes were employed with a 70/30 data split for accuracy.

## Findings
Our analysis revealed that Neural Network, Logistic Regression, and Naïve Bayes models consistently demonstrated high performance, with Neural Network outperforming others even after data transformation, specifically in terms of measuring recall. These models effectively classified credit applicants as “Good” or “Bad”.

## Recommendations/Conclusion
The discussion on implications for the banking sector highlights the potential losses from credit risk, emphasizing the need for effective credit risk assessment. Our models, especially the Neural Network, offer a promising approach to reduce loan defaults and increase profits by identifying high-risk applicants. The project underscores the significance of tailored approaches to credit risk management integrating cultural and regulatory factors.
